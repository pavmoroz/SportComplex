# SportComplex
This project was created in order to demonstrate my knowledge of relational database concepts, SQL and its extensions such as PL-SQL and Transact-SQL. Key concepts of my database for the Sport Complex are shown below.  1) Sport Complex consists of different sport halls (Swimming Pool, Gym, Crossfit Hall...), every sport hall should have a name and a description. 2) A lot of coaches work in the Sport Complex, their personal information and sallary have to be stored in the database. 3) Many coaches can work in a sport hall, but a coach can train people only in one sport hall. 4) Coaches have a lot of clients and clienta, as well can have a lot of coaches. 5) The database should store personal information of client and condition for visiting Sport Complex, in other words - information about client's pass. 6) A client can have only one pass. 7) A pass should have a type (student, normal...), status (active, inactive, frozen...) and prive. 8) Every client can have a training with a coach in some hall. History of these trainings should be stored in the database.
